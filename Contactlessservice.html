            <h1><b>Your frequently asked questions</b></h1>
        </center> 
        <ul><b>How does Contactless Delivery work?</b>

        <li>When placing your order online (web/m-site/app), please opt for ‘Contactless delivery’ and fill in the ‘driver instructions’ box at checkout with your chosen drop off location. You can write any brief description you like here to help navigate your delivery driver, for example: ‘end of driveway’, ‘by front door’ or ‘main entrance to block of flats’. Sometimes, our rider will also get in touch with you by phone to understand where the pizza needs to be placed.</li>

        <li>Our driver will place your order where instructed</li>

        <li>The driver will then call you to let you know your food has arrived</li>

        <li>The driver will then stand back 3 meters (or 3 large paces) and allow you to pick up your order without any physical contact</li>

        <li>Once you have collected your order, the driver will leave</li>

        <li>You will find your receipt placed on the top of your box</li>
    </ul>

    <ol><b>Will all orders be delivered as a Contactless Delivery?</b>
    <li>No. Only pre-paid orders can be opt-in as contactless delivery. Since we are trying to make this entire process contactless, cash-on-delivery in this case will not be possible.</li></ol>

    <ol><b>Does Contactless Delivery cost extra?</b>
    <li>No. We believe our customers deserve to feel as safe and comfortable as possible when ordering food in these uncertain times.</li></ol>

    <ol><b>Can my food go missing?</b>
        <li>No, our riders will leave your food on a clean surface at your doorstep, move back and stand at a safe distance for you to pick up your food. Your food will not be left unattended at any given point. If in case, you are not reachable, the food will be returned to the restaurant.</li></ol>

    <ol><b>What else is Pizza Hut Delivery doing to protect team members and customers?</b>
        <li>
            Maintaining the highest health and safety standards is always our top priority, and an essential part of the way our Huts are run. We have reinforced our stringent handwashing procedures and conduct daily temperature checks to ensure that employees who are feeling ill stay at home and seek appropriate medical attention.We have also increased the frequency with which we clean and sanitize our kitchen platforms, storage, door handles, delivery bags, boxes & dining facilities. Your order is delivered untouched right from our oven to your doorstep.
